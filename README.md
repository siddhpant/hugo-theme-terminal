# Terminal Hugo theme

This is the repo for the theme used on my blog [bodha](https://bodha.siddh.me).

This theme is a fork of [panr/hugo-theme-terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal), which has now been archived by the creator.

For the old (i.e. forked) README, see [README_old.md](README_old.md).

For config, refer to [siddhpant/siddhpant.github.io](https://github.com/siddhpant/siddhpant.github.io/).
